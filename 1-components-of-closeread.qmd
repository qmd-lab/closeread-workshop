This article is an introduction to the different components of a Closeread document. The three components of every Closeread document are:

1. A cr-section
2. One or more stickies
3. Triggers to draw focus to stickies

To kick the tires on these components, let's look at an simplified example of a study of penguins. It will feature three stickies: an image, a table generated from data, and a plot generated from data.

Penguins can be found as far north as the beaches of South Africa.

For this analysis we'll look at data collected on penguins in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. 

Here is a glimpse of the first 10 penguins in the data set. @cr-table

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(gt)

penguins |>
  slice_head(n = 10) |>
  select(species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) |>
  gt()
```

Not surprisingly, the depth of the bill increases as the length of the bill increases. However, each species has distinct ranges of length and depth that are observed.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618
ggplot( penguins,
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm,
      color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
```
